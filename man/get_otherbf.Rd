\usage{
get_evbf(q4, age)

get_eibf(age, q2, q2_hour)

get_ebf2d(q3, age)

get_mixmf(q4, age, q6b, q6c)

get_cbf(q4, age)

get_bof(q5, age)
}
\arguments{
\item{q4}{The binary variable which mentioned that the child was receiving
breastfeeding in the previous day (yes = "1", no = "0").}

\item{age}{This parameter holds the information about child age in the month
format.}

\item{q2}{the parameter indicate how long after the child was put to the
barest immediately after birth (0 = immediately, 1 = for hours and 2 = for
days)}

\item{q2_hour}{the integer parameter record the hour(s) after birth the child
was put to the breast}

\item{q3}{the binary variable indicating the child received anything else
beside breastmilk with the first two days after birth}

\item{q6b}{the binary variable indicates that the child got infant formula
feeding in the previous day}

\item{q6c}{the binary variable presents the child got any of the following
milk related food; Milk from animals, such as fresh, tinned or powdered
milk.}

\item{q5}{the binary variable presents the child received the bottle feeding
in the previous day}
}
\value{
binary variables indicate child met the respective breastfeeding
status or not (yes = 1 or no = 0)
