#' @title Determining Minimum Dietary Practices (from Core IYCF indicatros)
#'
#' @description Identification of individual 6-23 months old children dietary
#' practices meet the minimum requirement in terms of diversity, frequency and
#' acceptable diet
#'
#' There are 4 series of commands to identify the status of 6-23 months children
#' are meet the condition of minimum diet quality in terms of diet diversity,
#' meal frequency, and acceptable diet. The application of commend should follow
#' the order of this package arrangement as the output variables of the first
#' commend will be applied back in a later one. All the argument parameters used
#' in this library were based on the question numbers of the example IYCF
#' questionnaires provided by the WHO guideline.
#'
#' The first commend `get_mdd` is about the identification of minimum dietary
#' diversity.
#'
#' @param df Survey dataset (as an R data.frame) with the following variables
#'    present as mentioned in the table. All variables are compulsory for
#'    function processing. If the dataset did not contain those variables,
#'    please perform data processing to have those variables in the dataset.

#'
#' @param age This parameter holds the information about child age in the month
#'    format, and it should be the continuous variable. It is either generated
#'    from the child's birth date or self-reported answers from the caregivers.
#'    If this was generated from the calculation based on the child's date of birth,
#'    the decimal class of the variable would be the decimal numeric format.
#'

#'    breastfeeding yesterday (previous days), which were coded as "1", or
#'    not - as "0".
#'
#' @param q7b The variable contains the children information received any food
#'    items yesterday; Porridge, bread, rice, noodles, and pasta. If yes, the
#'    value was coded as "1" for meeting the condition, "0" for didn't, and
#'    "9" for don't know. The value coding pattern applied the same for all
#'    of the following parameters mentioned for this `get_mdd` function.

#'
#' The second command `get_mmf` is used to classify 6-23 months children received
#' the minimum meal frequency based on their breastfeeding status.
#'
#' @param age This parameter holds the information about child age in the month
#'    format, and it should be the continuous variable. It is either generated
#'    from the child's birth date or self-reported answers from the caregivers.
#'    If this was generated from the calculation based on the child's date of birth,
#'    the decimal class of the variable would be the decimal numeric format.
#'
#' @param q4 The binary variable which mentioned that the child was receiving
#'    breastfeeding yesterday (previous days), which were coded as "1", or
#'    not - as "0".
#'
#' @param q8 For this parameter, you should place the continuous variable,
#'    which contains the number of any solid, semi-solid, or soft foods the
#'    child received on the previous day (both day and night).
#'
#' @param q6bnum This parameter indicates the number of infant formula feeding
#'   the children received in previous days. The variable type should be a
#'   continuous variable.
#'
#' @param q6cnum This parameter holds information about the frequency of the
#'    children receiving the milk from animals, such as fresh, tinned, or
#'    powdered milk in the previous day.
#'
#' @param q6dnum For this parameter, you need to place the continuous variable,
#'    which presents the information about the frequency of the child receiving
#'    the yogurt drinks from the previous day.
#'
#' This `get_mmff` is designed to diagnose the non-breastfed children who meet
#' the minimum requirement of milk feeding frequency or not.
#'
#' @param age This parameter holds the information about child age in the month
#'    format, and it should be the continuous variable. It is either generated
#'    from the child's birth date or self-reported answers from the caregivers.
#'    If this was generated from the calculation based on the child's date of birth,
#'    the decimal class of the variable would be the decimal numeric format.
#'
#' @param q4 The binary variable which mentioned that the child was receiving
#'    breastfeeding yesterday (previous days), which were coded as "1", or
#'    not - as "0".
#'
#' @param q6bnum This parameter indicates the number of infant formula feeding
#'   the children received in previous days. The variable type should be a
#'   continuous variable.
#'
#' @param q6cnum This parameter holds information about the frequency of the
#'    children receiving the milk from animals, such as fresh, tinned, or
#'    powdered milk in the previous day.
#'
#' @param q6dnum For this parameter, you need to place the continuous variable,
#'    which presents the information about the frequency of the child receiving
#'    the yogurt drinks from the previous day.
#'
#' @param q7anum This parameter also represents the information about yogurt
#'    consumption frequency. Still, it counts other than yogurt drinks, and
#'    the variable came from the solid food consumption module from sample
#'    IYCF questionnaires.
#'
#'
#' The final command `get_mad` is the composition of all three main dietary
#' quality indicators generated by the previous three commands. It identifies
#' the children meet the minimum acceptable diet condition or not.
#'
#' @param age This parameter holds the information about child age in the month
#'    format, and it should be the continuous variable. It is either generated
#'    from the child's birth date or self-reported answers from the caregivers.
#'    If this was generated from the calculation based on the child's date of birth,
#'    the decimal class of the variable would be the decimal numeric format.
#'
#' @param q4 The dummy variable which mentioned that the child was receiving
#'    breastfeeding yesterday (previous days), which were coded as "1", or
#'    not - as "0".
#'
#' @param mdd This parameter holds whether the child received the minimum
#'    dietary diversity or not. The variable type must be the binary format
#'    as "1" indicated that the child got minimum dietary diversity and "0"
#'    meant didn't.
#'
#' @param mmf This parameter also must be the binary variable which indicated
#'    that the child got minimum meal frequency (coded as "1") or not
#'    (coded as "0").
#'
#' @param mmff This parameter is about the non-breastfed children received
#'    minimum milk feeding frequency or not. The variable type must be in the
#'    binary format as "1" for the children who met the required condition
#'    and "0" for those who didn't.
#'
#'
#' @return
#' Each command produces the respective matrix consisting of the new variables
#' generated by each command. If the argument add was applied in the command,
#' the output would be a new data frame attaching new variables generated from
#' each command. Those data frames have the same structure as the input
#' data frame in the command's parameters regarding the number of observations,
#' columns, and column names, except for differences in newly added variables
#' based on the command.
#'
#' In `mdd_df` data frame resulting from `get_mdd` command, the following new
#' variables are added, and each variable's detailed explanation is mentioned
#' below.
